# ShvikiFitness GitOps 🏋️‍♀️

An Argo CD App of Apps for deploying the ShvikiFitness application and its related infrastructure components. This project provides a GitOps-driven approach to manage the deployment of the ShvikiFitness application (Flask + MySQL), monitoring stack (kube-prometheus-stack), cluster autoscaler, and external secrets operator. It simplifies the deployment and management of the entire ShvikiFitness environment by orchestrating the deployment of other Argo CD Applications.

## 🚀 Features

- **App of Apps**: Manages the deployment of multiple Argo CD Applications as a single unit.
- **GitOps Driven**: Uses Git as the single source of truth for application deployments.
- **Automated Synchronization**: Automatically synchronizes application state with the Git repository.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Defines infrastructure components (monitoring, autoscaling, secrets) as code.
- **Node Placement Rules**: Configures node selectors and tolerations for workload deployments.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Manages all application configurations in a single `values.yaml` file.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed
- [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/) installed and configured in your Kubernetes cluster
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or a cloud-based cluster)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd shviki-fitness-gitops
```

2.  Customize the `values.yaml` file:

Modify the `helm/values.yaml` file to match your environment. Pay close attention to:

- `global.clusterName`: Set to your Kubernetes cluster name.
- `global.awsRegion`: Set to your AWS region (if applicable).
- `apps.shvikiFitness.repoURL`: Set to the repository URL of your ShvikiFitness application.
- `apps.monitoring`, `apps.clusterAutoscaler`, `apps.externalSecrets`: Verify the chart versions and repository URLs.

3.  Deploy the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install shviki-fitness ./helm -n argocd --create-namespace
```

*(Assumes Argo CD is installed in the `argocd` namespace. Adjust accordingly.)*

### Running Locally

After deploying the Helm chart, Argo CD will automatically start deploying the applications defined in the `values.yaml` file. You can monitor the progress in the Argo CD UI.

1.  Access the Argo CD UI:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argo-cd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8080`.

2.  Monitor the application deployments:

In the Argo CD UI, you should see the `shviki-fitness` application and its dependencies being deployed.

## 💻 Usage

Once the applications are deployed, you can access the ShvikiFitness application and the monitoring stack.

- **ShvikiFitness Application**: Access the application through the service exposed by the ShvikiFitness deployment.
- **Monitoring Stack**: Access the Prometheus and Grafana UIs through the services exposed by the `kube-prometheus-stack` deployment.

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

This repository follows an **App of Apps pattern**:

```
Git Repository (GitOps)
       │
       ▼
   Argo CD App of Apps
       │
       ├── ShvikiFitness Application (Flask + MySQL)
       ├── Monitoring Stack (kube-prometheus-stack)
       ├── Cluster Autoscaler
       └── External Secrets Operator
```

- **Argo CD** monitors Git and synchronizes all applications automatically.
- **Helm charts** define application deployments with configurable node selectors, tolerations, and environment values.
- **Centralized values.yaml** ensures all environments are consistent and manageable from a single source of truth.

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

The **ShvikiFitness GitOps repository** simplifies deployment, monitoring, and secret management for the entire platform. With GitOps principles and Argo CD, all deployments are **declarative, auditable, and automated**, enabling safe and repeatable operations across environments.
